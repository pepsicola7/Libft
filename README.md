# Libft – 42 Project

## 📖 Introduction
**Libft** was the very first project I completed at 42.  
The main goal is to **recreate standard C library functions** from scratch in order to:  
- Practice programming in C.  
- Understand how these core functions work internally.  
- Build a personal library that can be reused in future projects.  

This project is a foundation for many other 42 projects.

## 🛠️ Functions Implemented
The library contains re-implementations of many common C functions, including:  
- **String manipulation**: `strlen`, `strdup`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, …  
- **Memory management**: `memset`, `memcpy`, `bzero`, `calloc`, …  
- **Character checks**: `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `isalnum`, …  
- **Utilities**: `atoi`, `itoa`, …  

And additional helper functions defined by 42.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/libft.git
   cd libft
````

2. Compile the library:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Link it in your project:

   ```bash
   gcc main.c -L. -lft -o my_program
   ```

## 📚 What I Learned

* How to **code in C** with precision.
* How to **debug** and test my functions step by step.
* A deeper understanding of how **system functions work internally**.
* Good practices for **building and organizing reusable code**.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Libft is a challenging but essential starting point at 42.
It builds a strong foundation in C programming and sets the stage for all the following projects.
